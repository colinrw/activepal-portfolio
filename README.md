### Research project
<details> <summary>Task Definition</summary>

In the research plan I have written the second iteration of the problem domain/context while my teammates have worden on other parts. 
Where they have defined the research question among others. In the second iteration I have processed the feedback we got
from one of our teachers. 


``
Statistics Netherlands (CBS) has the wish to see if their respondents are moving for at least 150
minutes per week in moderately intense physical activity.
Currently, they are measuring by asking their respondent or health surveys. The issue with this is
that people are not very good at estimating the time they spent on moving and sport. This of course
causes that they don't have very reliable data to work with. Therefor CBS has been looking into
alternatives like the ActivPal accelerometer in combination with machine learning to give better and
more accurate results when measuring the intensity of certain activities.
Because of this the CBS started to collect lab tests and started to measure the movements of 41
correspondents in their regular workweek by using the Activepal Accelerator. It's our job to analyse,
structure and build machine learning algorithms based on the collected data to see if we can
determine if people adhere to (inter)national norm for physical activities and if we could measure
the intensity of movement (without the heart rate information).
