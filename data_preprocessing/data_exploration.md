# Data Exploration

## Created a script to look into activpal data

This was the first script used to look into data. 

script: [show_movement.py](evidence/show_movement.py)

# Created a script to plot data in 3d plot
The idea was to see if plotting data in 3d plot would be useful and it was not the case
script: [display_x_y_z.py](evidence/display_x_y_z.py)

## Looked into activities performed by participants
 | Dutch | English |
| ------ | ------ |
| lopen | walking |
| rennen |running |
| springen |jumping|
| staan | standing |
| traplopen | walking stairs |
| zitten | sitting|

script:  [activities_categories](evidence/activites_categories.ipynb)

## Created some plots of activites of certain user
The target was to see patterns in activities and what the difference are between them

Examples: 
- Cycling: [cycling_bmr002.png](evidence/cycling_bmr002.png)
- Walking: [walking_bmr002.png](evidence/walking_bmr002.png)
- Sitting: [sitting_bmr002.png](evidence/sitting_bmr002.png)
